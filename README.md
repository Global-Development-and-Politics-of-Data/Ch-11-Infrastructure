# Ch-11-Infrastructure Data Module 2021-04-20

This is the repository for Chapter 11 - Infrastructure of the Data for Development Policy Research Project (PRP)

## Abstract
The primary purpose of our data module is to introduce textbook users to global infrastructure data. The following excercises highlight how infrastructure data is susceptible to the politics of data because infrastructure lacks a clear definition; can be interpreted at the regional, state, subnational, and city level; and sources a variety of data within weighted aggregate indexes. 

Users will learn how to manipulate, clean, analyze, and visualize data in Microsoft Excel. The module aims to teach users good data management practices when merging multiple datasets from sources that use varying methodologies. Users should understand the importance of matching data types and methodologies and will learn how to match primary keys for relational databases. The metadata behind the indicators also reveals whether the data is intended for top-down market oriented development purposes or if the indicator reflects a holistic, pro-poor approach. The module highlights how the choice of indicators and statistical weights may influence the analytical results of a single score composite index for a complicated issue area.

## Data Sources 
Since infrastructure is a very broad concept, we integrated multiple data sources, selecting specific indices or indicators related to the three subtopic areas: housing, ICT, and transportation. Other potential topics, such as  water and energy infrastructure, were not included to avoid excessive repetition or overlap with other textbook chapters, but could have been included.This division of labor and research applies to drafting the chapter as well as finding and analyzing relevant data after jointly exploring the sustainable development goals (SDG) database platform. 


[SDG Database](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/)
  * Transport - 9.1.2 - Freight volume, by mode of transport (tonne kilometres or tkm)
  * ICT - 9.c.1 - Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology
  * Housing - 11.1.1 - Proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing
  * ICT - 17.8.1 - Proportion of individuals using the Internet

[UN Habitat Open Data](https://data.unhabitat.org/)
  * Housing - Basic Services Urban Indicators (Sufficient Living Area)
  * Transport - 11.2.1 - Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
