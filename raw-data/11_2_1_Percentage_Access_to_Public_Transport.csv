,"Indicator is computed as share of population who live within a walking distance (along a street network) of 500m to a low capacity public transport system (eg bus, tram) and 1000m to high capacity public  transport systems (trains, ferries, etc)",,,,,1222
,Only public transport stops which are mapped are included in the analysis and can include both formal and informal stops where available. Many cities have an informal network which is not fully mapped and may thus record higher levels of access to public transport than reported here,,,,,1223
,"Only public transport modes are considered, which do not include taxis",,,,,1224
,"Data on public transport stops is sourced from city maps, OSM, GTFS, UITP, Google, and point mapping in some cities. Estimates by DG REGIO are based on data from OSM, TomTom, NSIs, Eurostat, Copernicus Urban Atlas",,,,,1225
,"Data used to estimate population with access to public transport is based on grid level population disaggregation directly from city/country data, HRSL (facebook and CIESIN), WorldPop or GHS-Pop. Analysis year is 2019, which in some cases includes population data for 2018",,,,,1226
,City/urban area used in the analyis has been generated using a classification approach based on the Urban Extent or the Degree of Urbanization concepts to city definition,,,,,1227
